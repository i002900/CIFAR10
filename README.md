# CIFAR10
Multi-Class Classification.

The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60000 32X32 colour images in 10 mutually exclusive classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship and Truck.
This project illustrates thde following:
a) Build and deploy a multi-layer convolution neural network comprising of CONV2D filters, Batch normalization, Spatialdropout and Maxpoolng.
b) Ability to accept images of any size
c) Persist the model and use it for predicting a different of images

After 20 epochs, the model gave an accuracy of a little over 80%

The confusion matrix shows that Airplanes/Birds were most mis-classified followed by Cats/Dogs.
